# HOUSE PRICING PREDICTION

Predict house prices using regression models with scikit-learn.
Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison between Linear and Polynomial Regression.

## PROJECT GOALS

- Predict house prices based on features such as size, location, and number of rooms
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics
- Compare Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression

## TOOLS & LIBRARIES
