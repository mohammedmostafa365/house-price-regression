# HOUSE_PRICES.CSV DATASET

This repository contains a structured dataset of residential property sales with location, dwelling attributes, and proximity features (transport + schools). Each row represents a single property transaction.

## CONTENTS

- Property identity & area: ADDRESS, SUBURB, POSTCODE  
- Sale outcome: PRICE, DATE_SOLD  
- Home characteristics: BEDROOMS, BATHROOMS, GARAGE, LAND_AREA, FLOOR_AREA, BUILD_YEAR  
- Geospatial context: LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, CBD_DIST  
- Accessibility & amenities: NEAREST_STN, NEAREST_STN_DIST, NEAREST_SCH, NEAREST_SCH_DIST, NEAREST_SCH_RANK  

Example (first row, abbreviated):  
1 Acorn Place, South Lake, 565000, 4, 2, 2, 600, 160, 2003, 18300, Cockburn Central Station, 1800, 09-2018, 6164, -32.1159, 115.84245, LAKELAND SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL, 0.8283..., (rank missing)

## DATA QUALITY NOTES

- Some fields contain missing values (BUILD_YEAR, GARAGE, NEAREST_SCH_RANK)  
- DATE_SOLD may include hidden carriage returns ("09-2018\r") that should be stripped during import  

## COMMON USE CASES

- House price prediction (regression) using structural, location, and amenity features  
- Feature engineering (e.g., price per sqm, property age, distance bands)  
- Geospatial analysis (mapping prices by suburb, lat/long clustering)  
- Accessibility studies (impact of proximity to stations/schools on price)  

## HOW TO LOAD

**Python (pandas)**  
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("House_Prices.csv")
df["DATE_SOLD"] = df["DATE_SOLD"].astype(str).str.replace("\r", "", regex=False).str.strip()
df = df.replace("NULL", pd.NA)
